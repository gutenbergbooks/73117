  PREFACE.


This Index has been compiled from the Old and New Testament and Apocrypha,
the alterations in the Revised Version being noted in their places; from
the ‘Memoirs and Name Lists of the Survey of Western Palestine;’ from
that portion which is completed (as yet unpublished) of the ‘Memoirs
and Name Lists of the Survey of Eastern Palestine;’ from Smith’s ‘Bible
Dictionary;’ from the list drawn up by Sir George Grove for Clarke’s
‘Bible Atlas’ (S.P.C.K.); and from Conder’s ‘Handbook to the Bible’ and
‘Primer of Bible Geography,’ with numerous references to the ‘Quarterly
Statements.’ The identifications adopted are those that will be found on
the new maps (to be issued about the end of this year) of the Old and New
Testament, covering both sides of the Jordan, and authorized by Colonel
Sir Charles Wilson and Major Conder, R.E.

The Index to the Old Testament Sites includes upwards of 1,150 names of
places in the Holy Land, Mesopotamia, Edom, the Desert of Sinai, and
Egypt; being, it is believed, all those that are mentioned in the Old
Testament and the Apocrypha.

The Index to the New Testament Sites contains 162 names, with references
to Josephus (Whiston’s), in addition to those in the New Testament. Of
these names 144 are known, 10 uncertain, and 8 not identified.

The identifications suggested by Major Conder as due to the Survey are
marked with a star.

There are still 290 places mentioned in the Old Testament, in the East of
Jordan, the Desert and Western Palestine, which remain to be identified.
Reference is made in every case to the number of the sheet of the large
and small maps on which the modern name will be found. Under the heading
‘Remarks,’ etc., will be found fuller particulars of the proposed site
from the ‘Memoirs of Western Palestine.’

  OLD TESTAMENT SITES

(_Including all the Names to Sites in the Bible and Apocrypha._)

In the column ‘Modern Identification,’ those marked with a single ? are
doubtful; those with double ?? are very doubtful; those marked with a star
are due to the Survey. Abbreviations--‘R.V.’ is Revised Version; ‘A.V.’ is
Authorized (Old) Version; ‘Mem.,’ with the letters, refers to the _Memoirs
of the Survey of Western Palestine_; ‘Sh.’ is Sheet or Plan of the Large
Map, with the number where the name is found; ‘B. R.,’ _Robinson’s
Biblical Researches_.
